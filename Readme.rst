Browser support
---------------

Most of the features are directly available within your browser on your
configured domain, with SSL. Except password sync, you can achieve that by
configuring `<https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keepass-tusk/>
Firefox Tusk add-on`_


Installs your personal cloud, allowing backups and online/offline
(android/linux/windows) collaborative document editing (nextcloud +
onlyoffice), contacts syncronization, calendar synchronization, task list...

With KeePassDroid and KeePass Tusk you can sync your passwords safely between
devices.

Finally, it installs and configures a VPN server, so you just need to open the
one VPN port, and share your freshly-generated VPN config with your devices.
