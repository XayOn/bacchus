Freedom for your home and media. Fast setup to a libre solution on media
manamement, torrent automatic downloads, cloud and office on-cloud.

**Tired of installing the medusa/radarr/lidarr/transmission pack?**
**What about nextcloud and onlyoffice?**

This proyect aims to make personal cloud and media management solutions more
widely accesible, or at least a bit more painless to setup 

To do so, it exposes a few services under the same subdomain, with a self-signed ssl certificate and proxy-pass directives.


Features

Note that this is just an installer/bundle of the real tools that make the magic.

Series (medusa), favorite music (lidarr) and books (lazylibrarian).
Movies, TV Series, books and music auto-download.
All with the help of Jackett and transmission daemon for torrent search and
download.

Installs your personal cloud, allowing backups and online/offline
(android/linux/windows) collaborative document editing (nextcloud +
onlyoffice), contacts syncronization and calendar synchronization.
